Pickleball

When the time is right, SPRINT to the front.
Avoid No Man's Land.
Once at the frontline, never leave.

*** Stay low. Horse stance.

Most missed shots:
	Too high or hit too far. Tap like in ping pong.
	Missed block. Right side not ready.
	Hit the net. Get the spin right.
	Inaccurate: out to the side. Misread spin?

Aim for top of net!!!
