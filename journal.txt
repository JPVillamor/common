I am between thoughts right now. I have just enrolled for grad classes.
Fall semester will have ECE 510 and 514. 
I want to be prepared.
I can't be distracted anymore.
But at the same time I have work for CAT to do.
I realize...

This is going to be the same cycle/pattern when I am in school.
If NOTHING changes,
I will still procrastinate on work tasks.
I will still feel unnecessary stress because of my poor work ethic.
I will lose sleep.
I will ultimately kill my health.
I will hurt my grades.
I will underachieve.

... IF ...
Nothing changes.

But I can change something.

Small changes.
Small changes are the key.

Small changes.
Small changes add up.

Just make the small changes.

What are those small changes?
*** Prioritize work > entertainment. FFS be an adult.
*** Absolutely distraction-free work hours. 0900 - 1700
*** Regulate sleep time.
